## Guided Project Outline
*While this section is very much up to the style and descretion of the instructor and curiculum developer within a unit, it is worth considering if there are some consistent features to introducing a GP. For example, we could stipulate that the first module of the unit includes:*
- *An introduction of the Instructor*
- *An on-zoom introduction of the Associate Instructor, Student Success Coordinator and Support Hours Lead*
- *A description of the time and purpose of unit resources.*
- *A general overview of the unit purpose*

*Other possible standard cross unit GP outline topics could include:*
- *A first module of a sprint description, goal or focus statement.*
- *A standard signoff message reiterating daily student resources.*
- *A signoff message on the last module of the sprint with standard sprint challenge communication.*
- *A signoff message on the last module of the sprint unit discussing ties of current curriculum to the next unit.*
- *Or perhaps an introduction to one of the next unit's instructor.*

*The wording and style of deliver is not as important here as it is the consistence of where in the lecture the message is made and the general content of the message. TLDR: It's worth considering part of this section as a means to shape consistent student communication and consistent base student experience within a GP.*

## After Class Message
*This is a template for a slack message to be released immedately after the GP and has been very popular for our students. It also, after initial setup, a very easy thing to add into instructor flow and to expand on as new issues and topics of contension arise. Update this section with the lecture video once it is uploaded and process so students have a centralized place to find all of a module's reference materials.*
